This has all of my favorite Minecraft songs on it. This has quickly become the background music to my life. It is relaxing and calming and beautiful in a way that doesn’t make sense considering it’s the music to a block game. Even if you don’t play Minecraft this music with no vocals is great to have on in the background. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys calm beautiful music and or Minecraft. easter egg for Minecraft players the cd looks like the ones from the game.
